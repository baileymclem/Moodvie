## Project Overview 

The purpose of this project is to create a movie generating application (Moodvie) based on the user's mood. The application runs in the browser and features dynamic HTML and CSS while being powered by JavaScript code. The interface is responsive to any screen size. Moodvie takes user input from the GIF that best represents their mood and it will take them to a page of recommendations. Two API's were used in this application: 
* TMDB for the movies
* GIPHY for the selectable GIFs

User Story:

AS a person during quarantine <br />
I WANT to kill time <br />
SO I want to watch a movie <br />
GIVEN I'm using the app <br />
WHEN I open the app <br />
THEN the app loads <br />
WHEN I input MY MOODS <br />
THEN it provides the suggested movies <br />
WHEN I select a movie, it gives me a description so I can make my choice

## Frameworks
* Bulma
* jQuery 

## Issues 

Some of the issues we ran into while creating this application: 
* Using Bulma as a CSS framework 
    * It was not as user friendly as we hoped, there were some struggles trying to figure how to make it work and make it responsive
* Originally we were going to use an emoji API but we quickly found that because of the wide range of them, it was difficult to connect them to a genre
